Slide 2: Problem Statement
----------------------------
Current Challenges:
- Inefficiency in real-time note-taking and issue tracking during production calls.
- Difficulty for late joiners to catch up with the discussion context.
- Lack of in-depth analysis on time-consuming issues.
- Limited oversight for management on production issue resolution.

Slide 3: Proposed Solution Overview
-------------------------------------
Solution: An AI-driven bot integrated with Microsoft Teams that:
- Joins production calls to listen and generate real-time notes and summaries.
- Provides a summary update to late joiners upon joining.
- Analyzes discussions to identify areas where time is spent most.
- Sends email notifications to management with call updates.
- Generates reports highlighting recurring issues to inform process improvements.


An AI-driven bot joins production calls, listens to discussions, and generates real-time notes and summaries.

Provides a concise summary to late joiners, enabling them to quickly catch up on key points.

Analyzes discussions to identify topics or areas where significant time is spent, helping highlight potential bottlenecks.

Sends management timely updates via automated email notifications, keeping them informed of ongoing call progress and outcomes.

Generates detailed reports highlighting recurring issues, offering insights to support continuous process improvement.



Slide 4: How the Bot Works
----------------------------
Step 1: Bot joins the Microsoft Teams production call.
Step 2: Real-time transcription and note-taking.
Step 3: Summarization of ongoing conversations.

In the banking sector, efficient and timely resolution of production issues is essential for maintaining customer trust, regulatory compliance, and uninterrupted operations. Inefficiencies in handling these issues can lead to costly service disruptions, financial loss, and reputational risks. This AI-driven project aims to transform production calls by providing automated, real-time transcription, instant summaries, and deep insights into recurring issues and time allocation. For the team, this means seamless documentation and faster issue resolution, while management gains real-time visibility into critical incidents and automated insights into performance trends and recurring challenges. By streamlining these processes, this solution empowers banks to improve response times, reduce downtime, and maintain resilient, customer-focused operations.



Certainly:

1. Transcription Accuracy (WER): Measure transcription precision by calculating Word Error Rate against original spoken content.


2. Summarization Quality (ROUGE/BLEU): Evaluate summary coherence and relevance by comparing generated summaries with reference texts.


3. Issue Classification Accuracy (F1-Score): Assess model performance in identifying recurring issues using precision, recall, and F1-score.


4. Time Allocation Accuracy (MAE): Measure accuracy of estimated time allocation for specific topics by calculating Mean Absolute Error.


5. User Satisfaction and Feedback: Gather user feedback to assess the perceived value and effectiveness of summaries and insights.


Here are some possible use cases for this AI-powered production issue optimization tool:

Real-Time Meeting Summaries: Automatically generate concise, real-time summaries during production calls, allowing team members and late joiners to quickly catch up on critical updates.

Recurring Issue Detection: Identify and track recurring production issues over time, enabling proactive problem-solving and reducing repetitive incidents.

Automated Insights for Management: Provide management with real-time visibility into ongoing production challenges, along with automated performance metrics and insights into team productivity.

Time Allocation Analysis: Track and analyze time spent on various topics during calls, highlighting bottlenecks and helping optimize future issue resolution processes.
