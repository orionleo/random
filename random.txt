Your Name/Team: Presented by [Team/Presenter Name]

Slide 2: Problem Statement
----------------------------
Current Challenges:
- Inefficiency in real-time note-taking and issue tracking during production calls.
- Difficulty for late joiners to catch up with the discussion context.
- Lack of in-depth analysis on time-consuming issues.
- Limited oversight for management on production issue resolution.

Slide 3: Proposed Solution Overview
-------------------------------------
Solution: An AI-driven bot integrated with Microsoft Teams that:
- Joins production calls to listen and generate real-time notes and summaries.
- Provides a summary update to late joiners upon joining.
- Analyzes discussions to identify areas where time is spent most.
- Sends email notifications to management with call updates.
- Generates reports highlighting recurring issues to inform process improvements.

Slide 4: How the Bot Works
----------------------------
Step 1: Bot joins the Microsoft Teams production call.
Step 2: Real-time transcription and note-taking.
Step 3: Summarization of ongoing conversations.
Step 4: Sharing summarized notes when new participants join.
Step 5: Compiling and sending email updates to management.
Step 6: Analyzing conversation data to identify time-consuming topics.

Slide 5: Technical Approach
------------------------------
Technologies Used:
- Microsoft Teams Bot Framework for integration.
- Speech-to-Text API for real-time transcription (e.g., Azure Cognitive Services).
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for note-taking and summarization.
- Data Analysis Tools for time allocation insights.
- Email APIs for automated notifications.

AI Model Training:
- Continuous training to improve note-taking and context understanding.
- Analysis of recurring issues to generate actionable insights.

Slide 6: Key Features
------------------------
- Real-Time Note-Taking & Summarization: Automatic generation of detailed call notes and summaries.
- Instant Updates for Late Joiners: Summarized notes shared instantly to bring new participants up to speed.
- Email Notifications: Automatic updates sent to management, ensuring transparency and involvement.
- Recurring Issue Analysis: Identification of frequently discussed problems to preempt and reduce resolution times.

Slide 12: Q&A
---------------
Prompt for Questions: Open the floor for any queries or discussions.


Certainly:

1. Transcription Accuracy (WER): Measure transcription precision by calculating Word Error Rate against original spoken content.


2. Summarization Quality (ROUGE/BLEU): Evaluate summary coherence and relevance by comparing generated summaries with reference texts.


3. Issue Classification Accuracy (F1-Score): Assess model performance in identifying recurring issues using precision, recall, and F1-score.


4. Time Allocation Accuracy (MAE): Measure accuracy of estimated time allocation for specific topics by calculating Mean Absolute Error.


5. User Satisfaction and Feedback: Gather user feedback to assess the perceived value and effectiveness of summaries and insights.
