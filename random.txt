In the banking sector, efficient and timely resolution of production issues is essential for maintaining customer trust, regulatory compliance, and uninterrupted operations. Inefficiencies in handling these issues can lead to costly service disruptions, financial loss, and reputational risks. This AI-driven project aims to transform production calls by providing automated, real-time transcription, instant summaries, and deep insights into recurring issues and time allocation. For the team, this means seamless documentation and faster issue resolution, while management gains real-time visibility into critical incidents and automated insights into performance trends and recurring challenges. By streamlining these processes, this solution empowers banks to improve response times, reduce downtime, and maintain resilient, customer-focused operations.

Purpose of the Project:

Streamline production issue resolution by automating real-time transcription, note-taking, and summarization during calls.

Provide instant summaries to late joiners, enabling them to quickly catch up on critical information without disrupting the discussion.

Offer management real-time visibility and insights into ongoing production issues, team performance, and recurring problems.

Analyze discussions to identify time-consuming topics, helping teams identify and address bottlenecks.

Automatically page relevant support members to join calls when specific issues are identified, ensuring timely expertise is available for faster resolution.

Generate actionable reports on recurring issues and time allocation, supporting continuous process improvement and more efficient issue management.

Here's a refined and detailed workflow for the AI/ML-driven production issue resolution system, with the AI/ML model incorporated:


---

1. Production Call Initiation (Frontend - Microsoft Teams)

The AI bot joins a Microsoft Teams production call, actively listening to the ongoing conversation.

All participants can interact with the bot and access updates during the call.



---

2. Audio Capture & Speech-to-Text Conversion (AI/ML Model - Speech-to-Text)

Speech-to-Text: The AI model continuously transcribes the real-time audio from the call into text.

This transcription serves as the foundation for further analysis by the NLP engine.



---

3. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI Analysis (AI/ML Model - NLP & Text Analysis)

Summarization Engine:

The NLP model analyzes the transcribed text to extract key points and generates concise, real-time summaries (updated every 30 minutes).

The summary includes the ongoing status, actions taken, and any new developments.


Time Allocation Analyzer:

The AI identifies and logs time spent on different issues or topics discussed, highlighting areas where delays or bottlenecks occur.


Issue Detection & Classification:

Using machine learning algorithms (such as classification models), the system identifies recurring issues (e.g., database or network-related problems) by detecting patterns and keywords in the conversation.

The model categorizes issues based on historical data, determining whether they are related to infrastructure, databases, or other causes.




---

4. Support Paging System (AI/ML Model - Automated Paging)

The AI system automatically identifies when a specialized support team (e.g., database admins, network engineers) is required based on the issues detected.

The system triggers automatic paging, notifying and adding the relevant support members to the call.



---

5. Data Storage (Backend - Database Storage)

All transcriptions, summaries, and issue logs are stored in a central database for future reference and analysis.

The storage system also retains data on recurring issues, their causes, and resolutions, which can be used for long-term reporting.



---

6. Reporting & Management Insights (AI/ML Model - Report Generation)

The AI system generates a business impact report that consolidates the issue's frequency, root cause, and potential business impact. For example:

"This is the fourth database-related issue this month, linked to high query load. Impact: 15 minutes of service downtime."


These reports are automatically generated and sent to management with the most relevant insights and recommendations for future improvements.



---

7. Real-Time Notifications (Frontend - Notification System)

Late Joiner Summary: New participants automatically receive a real-time summary when they join the call.

Management Email Updates: Every 30 minutes, the bot sends automated email updates to upper management, providing a detailed overview of the issue's status, actions taken, and business impact.



---

8. Feedback Loop for AI/ML Model Improvement (AI/ML Model - Feedback and Refinement)

After the call, feedback from team members and management is collected on the accuracy and relevance of the summaries and insights.

This feedback is used to retrain and refine the AI/ML models for continuous improvement in issue detection, summarization, and issue resolution.

Diagram Flow Example:

1. User (Teams UI) → Real-time Audio Capture (via AI Bot) →


2. Speech-to-Text Model (Transcription of audio to text) →


3. NLP & AI Analysis:

Summarization Engine (Generates real-time summary)

Time Allocation Analyzer (Logs time per issue)

Issue Classification (Detects and categorizes recurring issues)



4. Paging System (Automatic notification to support team members) →


5. Data Storage (Stores transcription, summaries, and issue logs) →


6. Automated Reporting System (Generates business impact reports) →


7. Management Notification System (Sends updates to management via email) →


8. Feedback & AI Model Improvement (Collects feedback and improves models)




---

This workflow shows how each component of the system (from audio capture to reporting) integrates seamlessly, powered by AI/ML models, to provide real-time summaries, issue detection, and automated updates to improve production issue resolution.



Here’s the revised version with improved grammar and clarity:

Since this is an Asia inventory, it does not wait for BO confirmation.
Before the cancellation occurs in Impact, we are directly sending the parent and child to allocations.
As a result, the external status remains "Pending" in Impact while it is in the ParentTradeAction command, and the child allocations are not being canceled.
The external status is updated to "Cancel" just one second after it has been sent to allocations.

Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments!








Certainly:

1. Transcription Accuracy (WER): Measure transcription precision by calculating Word Error Rate against original spoken content.


2. Summarization Quality (ROUGE/BLEU): Evaluate summary coherence and relevance by comparing generated summaries with reference texts.


3. Issue Classification Accuracy (F1-Score): Assess model performance in identifying recurring issues using precision, recall, and F1-score.


4. Time Allocation Accuracy (MAE): Measure accuracy of estimated time allocation for specific topics by calculating Mean Absolute Error.


5. User Satisfaction and Feedback: Gather user feedback to assess the perceived value and effectiveness of summaries and insights.


Here are some possible use cases for this AI-powered production issue optimization tool:

Real-Time Meeting Summaries: Automatically generate concise, real-time summaries during production calls, allowing team members and late joiners to quickly catch up on critical updates.
