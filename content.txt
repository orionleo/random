Problem Statement:

Production issue resolution calls are critical for resolving urgent problems, yet they are often inefficient due to manual note-taking, lack of structured summaries, and limited visibility for management. Team members waste valuable time trying to document discussions, late joiners face challenges in catching up, and management does not receive timely updates on the callâ€™s progress. Additionally, there is no systematic approach to identify recurring issues or analyze which topics are consuming the most time, leading to repeated inefficiencies. This need is crucial in business, as delays in resolving production issues directly impact operational continuity, customer satisfaction, and overall productivity. T

The goal is to streamline production issue resolution calls by eliminating inefficiencies caused by manual note-taking, lack of structured updates, and limited visibility for management. To address this, an AI-powered solution integrated with Microsoft Teams can automate real-time transcription and summarization, provide up-to-date summaries to new joiners, and generate insights on recurring issues and time allocation. This will streamline workflows, enhance management visibility, and ultimately improve response times for production issues.

By developing this AI-driven project, we will automate real-time transcription, provide instant summaries for new joiners, and deliver insights on recurring issues and time allocation. This will result in faster, more efficient production issue resolution, improved management visibility, and enhanced overall productivity.
