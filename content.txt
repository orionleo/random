Problem Statement:
Production issue resolution calls are often inefficient and time-consuming, with team members manually taking notes and summarizing discussions. Late joiners struggle to catch up on the conversation, while management lacks timely, structured updates. Additionally, there is no systematic way to analyze recurring issues or identify topics that consistently consume significant time, leading to repeated delays in issue resolution. This results in prolonged production downtime, reduced productivity, and a lack of data-driven insights to improve the process. An AI-powered solution is needed to automate note-taking, provide real-time summaries, and deliver actionable insights to streamline production call workflows and enhance management visibility.
