Problem Statement:

Production issue resolution calls are critical for resolving urgent problems, yet they are often inefficient due to manual note-taking, lack of structured summaries, and limited visibility for management. Team members waste valuable time trying to document discussions, late joiners face challenges in catching up, and management does not receive timely updates on the call’s progress. Additionally, there is no systematic approach to identify recurring issues or analyze which topics are consuming the most time, leading to repeated inefficiencies. This need is crucial in business, as delays in resolving production issues directly impact operational continuity, customer satisfaction, and overall productivity. T

The goal is to streamline production issue resolution calls by eliminating inefficiencies caused by manual note-taking, lack of structured updates, and limited visibility for management. To address this, an AI-powered solution integrated with Microsoft Teams can automate real-time transcription and summarization, provide up-to-date summaries to new joiners, and generate insights on recurring issues and time allocation. This will streamline workflows, enhance management visibility, and ultimately improve response times for production issues.

By developing this AI-driven project, we will automate real-time transcription, provide instant summaries for new joiners, and deliver insights on recurring issues and time allocation. This will result in faster, more efficient production issue resolution, improved management visibility, and enhanced overall productivity.




The first half of the year has been a period of strong contribution and growth. Transitioning from a new joiner, I’ve delivered impactful work across multiple areas—completing all JIRA tasks on time, addressing vulnerabilities and bugs, writing test cases, executing Autosys jobs, and supporting server requirements. A key highlight was the high-priority Aladdin requirement, which involved close client coordination. I also contributed to the GenAI Hackathon, CSR initiatives, and supported Markets Mic through SharePoint management.

Going forward, I will focus on deeper involvement in CTM, Napa, and Trianna allocations, with a strong emphasis on understanding and delivering on allocation requirements. I plan to leverage GenAI tools for automation to boost system performance and continue strengthening my technical depth through regular study and development.

Risk expectations were fully met, with all DevelopYou trainings completed on time, RTOs maintained, and no compliance issues or TCI escalations, ensuring a secure and stable development environment.
